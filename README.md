# The Coding Train FreePascal Translation

I am deeply inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) YouTube channel and its [website](https://thecodingtrain.com/). 

Daniel Shiffman creates wonderful YouTube videos that are both educational and inspiring; he is truly a role model.

To honor this, I put together this GitHub repository with FPC ports inspired by the videos I’ve watched so far, built upon with my own experience.

In the [code](code/) subfolder, you will find a list of subfolders, each starting with the number of the corresponding Coding Train video, followed by the video title.

This repository is a work in progress — some videos may be missing because I haven't watched them yet or haven't published the corresponding port.

If you're interested in seeing a specific Coding Train video ported to FPC, feel free to open a new issue and request it!
