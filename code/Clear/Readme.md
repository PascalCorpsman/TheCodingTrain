# Clear application

On some challenges i decided to go as close as possible to the JavaScript or NodeJs version. These challenges do only have minimal units.
To be able to compile them and "emulate" the JavaScript framework i added this "clear" project that holds all the shared code.

It is possible to compile this projects but would make actually no sense, as it is only a placeholder.
