# 171 - Wave Function Collapse: Tile Model

This is the first approach to takle wave function collapse algorithms.

Here is the link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM)

The follor up challange is [186](../186%20-%20Wave%20Function%20Collapse:%20Overlapping%20Model/)

As i already puplished the results before creating this repository, i only put in here a [link](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/mini_projects/tree/main/miniprojects/Wave_function_collapse/Tile_model) to my miniprojects where you can access all the corresponding code.
